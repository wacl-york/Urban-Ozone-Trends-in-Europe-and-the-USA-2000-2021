![Scientific figure showing average Urban MDA8O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> (top to bottom) in Europe and the USA (left to right) between 2000 and 2021. Colours show different subgroups of all, day time, night time, warm season and cold season. Years where the regions experienced heat waves are particularly prominent in the MDA8O<sub>3</sub> warm season. MDA8O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> groups show increases in Europe, warm season MDA8O<sub>3</sub> is slowly decreasing in the USA, where cold season is increasing. NO<sub>2</sub> has decrease across the period.](figures/f01_overview.png)
